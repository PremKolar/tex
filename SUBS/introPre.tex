\newthought{The main purpose }  of this study is to create a computer program that is able to \textbf{detect}, \textbf{track} and \textbf{analyse} meso-scale ocean eddies via their surface signal in sea-surface-height (SSH). Due to the inherently technical character of the matter, large parts are dedicated to technicalities of the algorithm \footnote{see the methods-\cref{chap:algorithm}.}. Oceanographic results are treated in the \href{chap:results}{results}- and \href{chap:discussion}{discussion}-chapters. This chapter discusses the physics of meso-scale geostrophic turbulence and introduces a handful of relevant historical papers. Since focus is on horizontal scales, translational speeds and the comparison of results between the \AVI-altimetry product and SSH-data from the \POP ocean model, sections generally focus on either of these three topics.
