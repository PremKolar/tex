\TODO{Further study in refining this structure is expected, and the refined struc- ture can serve as a benchmark for numerical models where mesoscale eddies are explicitly resolved. In addition, the generation mechanism for this universal structure remains unknown; thus, exploring such mechanism may bring new excitement to eddy research.
