Several global mesoscale ocean-eddy-dynamics censuses were obtained via an automated, sea-surface-anomaly-based detection- and tracking-algorithm. 12 years of input sea-surface-height data were taken from a satellite-altimetry product and from a global eddy-resolving ocean model. Variables of particular interest were horizontal eddy scale and zonal eddy drift speeds. Motivation was to answer the question whether time- and space-resolutions of the altimeter-product are sufficiently fine to resolve eddy scales accurately and to allow a successful tracking of individual eddies over time. The results suggest that the $\ang{0.25}$-resolution of the merged satellite scans is insufficient to resolve realistic eddy scales in high latitudes and that a $\SI{7}{\day}$ time-step to determine eddy drift-speeds is likely insufficient in regions of strong drift-vector gradients.
